    <description>Born beneath the towering chimneys of the Grand Forge, [PAWN_nameDef] grew up with fire and steel as [PAWN_possessive] only companions. While others played, [PAWN_pronoun] watched the master smiths shape metal into weapons of legend. By the time [PAWN_pronoun] could walk, [PAWN_pronoun] had learned the weight of a hammer. By the time [PAWN_pronoun] could read, [PAWN_pronoun] had memorized the blueprints of masterwork armor. Elders whispered that [PAWN_nameDef] was destined to craft wonders beyond imagination, a future shaped by the ringing of steel on anvil.</description>

    <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was the last of [PAWN_possessive] kind, the final master of an art lost to time. In a world where steel had become obsolete, [PAWN_pronoun] forged weapons that could cut through plasteel and armor that could withstand railgun fire. Every strike of [PAWN_possessive] hammer wrote history in tempered alloys, cryptofused plating, and weapons that defied physics itself. But when [PAWN_possessive] ship fell, the forges cooled and the secrets of the craft faded into legend. Now, wandering among the ruins of [PAWN_possessive] past, [PAWN_pronoun] carries the weight of a lost age, the guilt of being the last one.</description>
