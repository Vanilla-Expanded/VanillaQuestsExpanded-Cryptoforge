	<VQE_HeroJoinsDesc>The {PAWN_title} known as {PAWN_nameDef} has emerged from a cryptosleep casket in a daze. Once they regain their bearings, they will join your colony.\n\n{PAWN_nameFull} is the legendary blacksmith of a renowned spacefaring civilization, famed for their mastery of cryptoparticle technology. A gifted crafter and battle-hardened warrior, {PAWN_labelShort} wears a set of cryptotech armor from their lost people. But beneath their skill and strength lies a heavy burden of guilt, a unique psychological condition born from the crushing sorrow of being the last living member of their civilization. This grief gnaws at {PAWN_possessive} mind over time, slowly deepening into despair. However, engaging in work that aligns with their passions: especially crafting, can slow the progression. If managed carefully, the guilt will eventually transform into acceptance, and with time, begin to fade.</VQE_HeroJoinsDesc>
